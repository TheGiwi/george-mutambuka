I created this spaceship to accompany the concept cyborg character which it shares the same theme centered around a space mining company.
I’m thinking of creating more ships with different cargo and freight functions.
The bigger picture is to create various assets that have to do with space mining and freight handling for a fictional space mining company.
However, since I’m doing this as a side project, time I will tell how far I’ll progress with it.
