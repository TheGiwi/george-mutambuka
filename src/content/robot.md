Hard surface robot design I made as a personal project.
This robot is inspired by Alberto Buzzi's drone which you
can view here https://artstation.com/artwork/Pmo6eL

The model consists of spheres with boolean modifiers and
kitbashing (from Creative Shrimp and some made by myself).
I to achieve CAD like bevels and cuts, used the bevel modifier
and Blender's then new weighted normal
and weld modifiers
