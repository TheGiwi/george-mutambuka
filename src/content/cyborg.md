The story behind this concept is one of former military cyborg
soldier named Ife-M who is now a space freight-ship captain
with the T4 Space Freight company.

I didn't want to create a full military style cyborg so
I thought melding a civilian job with a former military
soldier would give me something interesting to work with.
