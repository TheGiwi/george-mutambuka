This is a personal project I didn't have any blueprints but used reference images from the product website http://www.krksys.com/Classic
This project is available for download on Blendswap https://www.blendswap.com/blend/24177 and
CG Trader https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/electronics/audio/krk-classic-5-studio-monitor-speakers

The materials are procedural textures created within Blender, which are editable on the native .blend project.
Material texture PNGs were baked out aswell.
