The first month of 2018 is already zooming by and I feel that it may be a bit too late for me to be writing this. But any-who, I let procrastination get the better of me but as the saying goes; better late than never.

As a new year brings new excitement and ambitions in our hearts, - though it's just another day we are the same on January 1st as we were on December 31st - the vast majority of the populace make new year's resolutions, but I would like to share how I have personally come to view this time of year.

I no longer make new year's resolutions, but instead I make decisions based on what ever state my life is in. I like to refer those states as "phases", some phases can last years, others months, some are periodic and last a few weeks only to pop up again some months later. They can also run concurrently, some are related to one another others aren't - that's just how complicated life is on this planet we call Earth.

Figuring out what phase I'm in and what is required of me at that specific time is the real test that will determine if I will get favorable results.

So as this year moves on, I'm reminded of what the book of Ecclesiastes Chapter 3 says; there is a time for everything.  Thus, it is up to us to discern what time it is, so we can know what it is that needs to be done.

In conclusion, may you look to this new year as a time to assess your life so far and plan on wards.  But don't wait for the end of 2018 to make an assessment on your progress, constant assessment of our lives will get us to our destination in a clear manner because what may look like a clear path now may not be all so good once it's walked on.
