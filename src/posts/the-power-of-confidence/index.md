You will not be on top of the world or elated at all times; Situations happen that will get you down. And especially in the creativity hustle; the downs get you down for sure, even in your successes you can't celebrate for long because you have to focus and look to the next challenge that could bring you a downfall. I have found that instead of feeding on my happiness or happy moments, I should build my confidence and feed on that. Happiness is just a fluid emotion, but confidence is a sure foundation, when you are convinced of your strengths and are humbled but not discouraged by your shortcomings, you're in the right position to conquer anything. I say right position to conquer because a confident person doesn't need to be in the advantage or feel good about a challenge, all a confident person needs is a chance, a shot at goal, the right positioning. All else follows. The fear of failure can never frighten one that is confident.

Enjoy your week everyone ðŸ¤“
