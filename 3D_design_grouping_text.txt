Back Pack Product Render


Back back I created and rendered in Blender with
materials done in Substance Painter.
This was a personal project.

Procedural Material Authoring 


Created this procedural material using Substance Designer and
then I recreated it from scratch in Blender nodes as a challenge
to see if I can create the same material using different software.
The project is available for download on the links below:

Concept Cyborg Character


The story behind this concept is one of former military cyborg 
soldier named Ife-M who is now a space freight-ship captain 
with the T4 Space Freight company.

I didn't want to create a full military style cyborg so 
I thought melding a civilian job with a former military 
soldier would give me something interesting to work with.

KRK Speakers Short Animation


This is a personal project I didn't have any blueprints but used reference images from the product website http://www.krksys.com/Classic
This project is available for download on Blendswap https://www.blendswap.com/blend/24177 and 
CG Trader https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/electronics/audio/krk-classic-5-studio-monitor-speakers

The materials are procedural textures created within Blender, which are editable on the native .blend project.
Material texture PNGs were baked out  aswell.

Hard Surface Robot Concept


Hard surface robot design I made as a personal project.
This robot is inspired by Alberto Buzzi's drone which you 
can view here https://artstation.com/artwork/Pmo6eL 

The model consists of spheres with boolean modifiers and 
kitbashing (from Creative Shrimp and some made by myself).
I to achieve CAD like bevels and cuts,  used the bevel modifier 
and Blender's then new weighted normal 
and weld modifiers    


-----------------------


Spaceship Concept


I created this spaceship to accompany the concept cyborg character which it shares the same theme centered around a space mining  company.
I’m thinking of creating more ships with different cargo and freight functions. 
The bigger picture is to create various assets that have to do with space mining and freight handling for a fictional space mining company. 
However, since I’m doing this as a side project, time I will tell how far I’ll progress with it.

Jewelry Product Render


Created these renders for a client a few years ago.
They were created from drawings the client provided and I had
to create 3D printable versions and product renders.
